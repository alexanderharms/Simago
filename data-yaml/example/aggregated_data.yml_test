# Aggregated data
# Describes the data to turn into the probability distributions
property_name: "Property Name"
data_type: "categorical" # or "ordinal" or "continuous"

# If data_type == "categorical" or "ordinal", there must be data in a file.
# If "categorical", there should be a table with per row the option name,
# and the value, the amount of people, for that option.
# If "ordinal", there should be a table with per row the option name or 
# a range of option names, and then per option (range) the amount of people
# for that option (range). Option names should be expressed in numbers 
# starting at 0. Per row the labels per option should be noted.
# If the values only hold for a conditional population, per row a
# conditional ID is needed. 
data_file: "./data/data_filename.csv"

# If "continuous" there is no dataset, there are parameters
# Each element of the list of pdf parameters corresponds to the conditional of
# the same index.
# pdf_parameters: [[1, 0]] # List of parameters
# File to the function that defines the probabililty distribution function.
# This function should take the list of parameters as the first argument. 
# pdf_file: "pdf.py" 
# pdf: "pdf_function" # Function for the PDF

# Some values for options of a property only hold for a subset of the 
# population. These values are then turned into a conditional probability. 
conditionals: null # null if no conditionals
# If there are conditionals, a filename is needed. The file indicates per row
# the conditional ID, the property and option (for categorical and ordinal 
# properties) or value (for continuous) on which the value is conditional.
# Also an indication of the relation to these options/values should be given,
# meaning 'eq', 'geq', 'gr', 'leq' or 'le' for "equal to", "greater or equal
# to" etc.
